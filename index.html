        <div class="circular"> <img src="me.jpg"></div>
        <p>
            <span class="hello"> Hello! </span><br><br>
            I am a developer passionate about technology and applying technological solutions to everyday problems. As
            part of my personal growth journey, I continuously strive to learn new things everyday. It was during my
            undergraduate years when I formally developed an interest in the tech industry, and as a result, began my
            pursuit of a career in software. When I first arrived at Rutgers I was enrolled in the Business School as
            that was
            my original interest before I transitioned to computer Science. I ended up going with Computer Science, and
            minored in
            Business Management with an HR Concentration, and participated in the Rutgers Business Leadership Program in
            2019, the topic of the program that year was Emotional Intelligence. My interest in the global business
            world and finance remains,
            but now, besides coding, I play a variety of sports recreationally and like to go out and watch sports with
            friends as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon arriving at Rutgers, I started working for the IT Help Desk on campus where I eventually transitioned
            to full time
            after I graduated in January of 2021. I currently serve as a Tier 3 IT Technician where I assist with both
            in-person
            troubleshooting and remote. I also am in charge of planning and building classroom AV equipment. I am
            proficent in JavaScript/CSS/HTML
            with a desire to learn more JAVA and look into AWS. I also have experience scripting using powershell within
            a remote linux machine at my
            residence. I am eager to transition into software development as this field is an integral part of society
            and is only getting more prevelent
            as technology evoles.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2> Water Utility Mover App </h2>
        <p>
            This project was a collaboration between myself and four other team members. We created a web app for
            consumers to change their water utility service to a new location on a scheduled date. This app was designed
            using Flask, SQL, Python, and HTML. We used the USPS Address Validator API to verify the addresses the user
            entered were valid. A validator method was created to verify the user entered a valid future date.
        </p>

        <h2> Personal Website</h2>
        <p>
            I created this website as practice and went through many iterations before picking some of my favorite
            elements from the different variations I created. It is an on-going project that will continue to expand as
            I gain experience. While in school, I was not exposed to JavaScript nor CSS. Through the development of this
            website, I was able to learn to implement various methods of responsive web design. I incorporated JQuery
            for smooth scrolling
            along wiht a sticky chevron button was added to smooth scroll back to the top of the page.
        </p>

        <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently working on mobile compatibility for this website. I previously incorporated support for
            various browsers and window resizing, but I am noticing scaling issues on mobile devices.

        <h1>Future Projects and Ideas</h1>
        <h2>Company Web or Mobile App</h2>
        <p>
            I am planning to create an app that can help a company respond to requests from a customer that will mimic
            the Dominos pizza tracking feature. How it would work is a customer would put in a request of any kind that
            needs to be approved and pushed through a few different stages. Which will be represented on the tracker
            widget to let the customer know what stage of the process he is in and some sort of time frame.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <p>
            1. Develop a way to automatically clip digital coupons on food store web sites <br>
            2. Create a docker to assist with development on my personal home server<br>
            3. Develop an app that further assists with home automation.
